# Classic Jekyll Theme settings

# Classic uses three columns Primary, Secondary and Tertiary.
# The primary column is always present and cannot be manipulated.
# The secondary column is optional and is either to the left or to the right of the primary.
# The tertiary column is optional and if present will be opposite the secondary column in the wide display and below the secondary in the medium display.
# In the narrow display all three columns will be below each other (if present)
# If the tertiary column is used, the secondary column *must* also be used.

# Controls the placing and visibility of the secondary column
# Values: left | right | none
# - left: The secondary column appears on the left side of the main column
# - right: The secondary column appears on the right side of the main column
# - none: There is no secondary column (note that this also inhibits the tertiary column)
# Here the default value is defined, pages may override this in their front matter.
# The secondary column must reside in the "_includes" directory and is called "secondary-column.html"
# Front matter can specify a different file for the secondary column ("secondary-column-content").
#
secondary-column: left

# Controls visibility of the tertiary column
# Values: present | none
# - present: The tertiary column is visible.
# - none: There is no tertiary column.
# The tertiary column is always on the opposite side of the main column from the secondary column.
# Here the default value is defined, pages may override this in their front matter.
# The tertiary column must reside in the "_includes" directory and is called "tertiary-column.html"
# Front matter can specify a different file for the tertiary column ("tertiary-column-content").
#
tertiary-column: present

# For the number of posts visible on the home page.
# Value: > 0
#
number-of-posts-on-home-page: 5

# For the number of posts titles shown in the 'recent' widget
# Value: > 0
#
number-of-recent-posts-in-widget: 10

# Enables or disables the cookies warning.
# Values: yes | no
#
enable-cookies-policy: yes

# Place the navbanner in the main column
# Values: top | main
# - top: The navigation banner will be placed above all the columns
# - main: The navigation banner will be placed inside the main column at the top.
# This is the default value, it may be overriden by YAML frontmatter.
#
# Hint: It may be advantageous to set the $navbanner-include-banner value in the classic-jekyll-theme.scss to 'false' if this value here is set to 'true'.
#
navbanner-position: top

# Create a separate file containing the Navigation & Banner
# Values: yes | no
#
# Using a separate navbanner file will speed up jekyll compilation a lot. However it also means that the browser has to make two additional fetches: the navbanner file and the JQuery library (the later from google). However this is mitigated by the fact that both files can be cached by the browser.
# If another JQuery library has to be used, edit the _includes/head.html file accordingly.
#
# Note: If this option is set to 'yes', then make sure the file 'navbanner.md' is present (can be found in the theme folder) in the same project folder as the index.md file.

use-separate-navbanner: yes

# End of file
